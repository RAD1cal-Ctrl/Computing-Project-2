# 🎮 Mental Health Pixel Game

This is a top-down pixel-style game (inspired by classic Pokémon games) designed to help 9–11-year-olds learn about mental health through fun, interactive minigames.

## 🧠 What’s It About?

You play as a student walking through a schoolyard where you can meet three unique characters, each dealing with different mental health challenges. By helping them through simple minigames, players learn healthy coping strategies.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Talk to each character and play their game to support them with their struggles:
  - **Yassine**: Social Anxiety → *Brave Talk* (conversation game)
  - **Jaden**: Anger & Frustration → *Cool-Down Coach* (breathing + pattern tracing)
  - **Evie**: Perfectionism & Self-Doubt → *Happy Accidents* (creative drawing game)

## 🕹 How to Play

- **WASD** – Move around the map  
- **E** – Interact with nearby characters  
- Walk up to an NPC to trigger a textbox (UI is still in development)  
- Complete all three minigames to support your classmates and win the game!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

This project was made by a team of 7 on paper, but in reality, only 3 of us actually worked on the code. So if you spot bugs or unfinished features (like textboxes not popping up or games not launching properly), now you know why.

## 💻 Commit Info

Most of my commits don't show up on GitHub because Git was using a randomly generated temporary email by default — I didn’t realise until pretty late in development. But everything was tracked and pushed using the GitHub Desktop app on my end.
